            <p>Welcome to Caterpillar OS. This is a browser-based operating system that the team has built during our final week of iO Academy. The OS was primarily built on the front-end using React-based JavaScript and styled using Tailwind CSS, however we have included some back-end features using PHP to perform tasks such as recognizing a logged-in user and extracting data from an API we have built using an SQL database.</p>
